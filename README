PyLint report is shown in a window. The report can be refreshed with a single
key press.

PyLint is a static code analyzer that can tell you where (in which lines) you
should do some changes to the code. However, if you add or remove some lines
in the source code, the report's line numbers become invalid. By pressing
a single key ('r', 'u', or F5), you can refresh the report.

The behaviour of PyLint can be controlled with a configuration file (see the 
attached .pylintrc file). If you copy it to your HOME folder, PyLint will
take it into account. Feel free to customize this file.
